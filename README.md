# Overview

This is a private version of the project repo we send to candidates. It's a basic Rails CRUD app for displaying and editing dog profiles, where candidates can refactor existing code and add features as part of a technical assesment. Setup instructions are in the readme of the [public repo](https://github.com/barkbox/project-challenge).

# Challenge Ideas

### Backend/Fullstack
- Add pagination to index page
- Add multiple images per dog (display and form)
- Associate dogs with users
- Allow editing only by owner

### Frontend
- Add a grid, layout work
- On profile, add carousel

# Additional Questions
- What would you change before putting this on production?

# Challenge Solutions
As we come up with solutions for these challenges, we will add them as branches.
