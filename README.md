# Overview

This is a private version of the project repo we send to candidates. It's a basic Rails CRUD app for displaying and editing dog profiles, where candidates can refactor existing code and add features as part of a technical assesment. Setup instructions are in the readme of the [public repo](https://github.com/barkbox/project-challenge).

# Challenge Ideas

### Backend/Fullstack
- Add pagination to index page
- Add multiple images per dog (display and form)
- Associate dogs with users
- Allow editing only by owner

### Frontend
* On the dog detail page that has more than one profile image, (ex http://localhost:3000/dogs/5), display profile images in a functioning carousel.
  * Feel free to use vanilla JS or a carousel library.
* Use flexbox, CSS grids, or a grid framework to display the homepage's dog profile thumbnails in a responsive grid layout.
  * On mobile, the thumbnails should be 1 across, on tablet they should be 2 across, and on desktop they should be 3 across.

Note: This project is based on a Rails 5 boilerplate scaffold. New styles can be added to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css, and new JS can be added to app/assets/javascripts/application.js. If you choose to add external CSS or JS, you can add a CDN hosted-library to a `<link>` or a `<script>` tag in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
